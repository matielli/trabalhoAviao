# Development Process

## Initial Planning

We started with online research on different paper plane models.

## Prototyping

Each team member folded and adjusted the models, testing different shapes to improve stability and flight distance. Materials were kept the same to avoid variations.

## Testing

Tests were carried out in both indoor and outdoor environments. For each flight, we recorded the distance, flight time, and wind conditions.

## Final Adjustments

Based on the results, we made small adjustments to the leading edge and tail of the model to improve performance.
