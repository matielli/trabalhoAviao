# Final Report

## Objective

To develop and test different paper plane models, identifying which configuration provides the best flight performance.

## Methodology

We selected the best model based on our research and tested it manually, recording flight time and distance. Environmental conditions were noted for each launch.

## Results

The model we chose performed well, reaching a distance of 6.5 meters and a flight time of 4 seconds in an outdoor environment.

## Conclusion

The project allowed us to apply basic concepts of aerodynamics, data recording, and result analysis. Small changes in design showed a significant impact on performance.

All data and media are organized in the appropriate folders of this repository.
